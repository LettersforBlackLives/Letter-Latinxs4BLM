### An open letter from [Latinxs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159) to our families

(español sigue abajo)

Querida Familia:

We need to talk.

We want you to understand why Black lives are so important to us and hope you will join us in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The peace and security, opportunities and joy we seek as Latinxs are intertwined with the Black community. The struggles we are facing overlap with theirs quite literally, and it’s time for our community to be vocal in support of what is happening.

Black people are a fundamental part of our lives: they are our friends, neighbors, classmates, teammates, roommates, and let’s not forget, part of our families. [Black Latinos are a significant part of our community as well](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/01/afro-latino-a-deeply-rooted-identity-among-u-s-hispanics/). Today, we are scared for all Black people in the United States.

This year, [the American police have already killed more than 500 people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/). Of those, 25% have been Black, even though Black people make up only 13% of the population. Last week in Louisiana, two White police officers killed a Black man named Alton Sterling while he sold CDs on the street. The very next day in Minnesota, a police officer shot and killed a Black man named Philando Castile in his car during a traffic stop while his girlfriend and her four-year-old daughter watched. Overwhelmingly, the police [do not face any consequences](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/04/11/thousands-dead-few-prosecuted/) for ending these lives.

Our community knows these tragedies, too. [Anthony Nuñez, Melissa Ventura](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/5-Latinos-Killed-by-US-Cops-This-WeekAnd-Media-Ignored-It-20160708-0024.html), [Pedro Villanueva](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-chp-shooting-vehicles-20160705-snap-story.html) and [Alex Nieto](https://justice4alexnieto.org/alex-story/) were all killed by police officers, though none of it was caught on film.

Yet even as we hear about the dangers faced by interactions with police, our instinct is sometimes to distance ourselves from the victims (and this social justice issue), especially when the victims are Black. We wonder why they didn’t “just obey the officer” or we look for other information about the victim that justifies their death. When a policeman shoots a Black person, you might think it’s the victim’s fault because you see so many media images showing Black people as “thugs” and criminals. Those images take hold in people’s minds — ours included. It becomes too easy to see our Black neighbors as “dangerous” before ever seeing them as human. This mentality started before the founding of the United States when the first Africans were brought to this continent as slaves.

Many will try and turn our communities against each other because we are more powerful together than apart. They will use the same untrue stereotypes they use about us being criminals, even when there is no relationship between crime and the [violence that happens against Black people by police](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/2015). But these messages are not all coming from outside our community. On Spanish-language television, there are [too many instances of anti-Black sentiments](http://alldigitocracy.org/the-dark-side-of-hispanic-tv/). We have to look critically at all voices when anti-Black hatred is spoken.

But when the Latinx community is at its best, we are empathetic. We extend ourselves to friends and neighbors, especially in times of need. It might not always be our style to be vocal, marching in the streets in protest. But it is our style to resist injustice. From César Chavez to Rigoberta Menchú and the Mirabal Sisters, we have always been committed to a higher calling, demanding dignity for people who are being persecuted. We need to do it again, now, on behalf of victims of police violence, including our Black friends and family.

When someone is walking home and gets shot by a sworn protector of the peace — even if that officer is Latinx — that is an assault on all of us, and on all of our hopes for equality and fairness under the law.

It is true that our community already has a lot to be worried about. From immigration raids and the fear of deportation for our undocumented friends and family to the hateful rhetoric of some politicians, it is hard to be Latinx in this country. But we are a smart, loving community that can care about many things at once.

As Archbishop Oscar Romero said, “There are many things that can only be seen through eyes that have cried.” Our eyes have cried for injustice, and we have prayed together for many reasons. We are asking you to add the Black Lives Matter movement to your prayers and your actions.

Part of that support means speaking up when we see people in our community — or even our own families — say or do things that diminish the humanity of Black people in this country.

We are telling you this out of love, because we don’t want this issue to divide us. We are asking that you try to empathize with the anger and grief of the families who have lost their loved ones to police violence, Latinxs and Black alike. We are also asking you to empathize with our anger and grief, and support us if we choose to be vocal, to protest, to be defiant in the face of authority. We would also like you to share this letter with your friends, and encourage them to be empathetic, too.

This will not go away just because we choose to ignore it. If anything, turning a blind eye will further the ability for officers to target all of us with no accountability for their actions. Being scared of Latinx and Black people should never be enough of an excuse to kill us.

As Latinxs, we are proud and eternally grateful to those who came before us. We are proud of those who came to this country and persisted in a place that has not always been kind to our community. We are proud of our indigenous roots and the resilience of people who instantly became outsiders on their own land. They suffered through a prejudiced America, to bring the next generations closer to freedom.

I hope you can consider this: pursuit of a better life cannot exist for us alone. We are all in this together, and we cannot feel safe until ALL our friends, loved ones, and neighbors are safe. The future we seek is a place where all people can live without fear of police violence. We hope it is the future you want, too.

Con amor y esperanza,

Sus hijas, hijos, sobrinos, sobrinas, nietos y nietas
